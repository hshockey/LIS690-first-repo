# Learning GitHub and Markdown
Here, I am learning how to add information in GitHub with Markdown

## Heading Practice

When creating bold text, you want to **double asterisks the words**

However, when wanting to italicize something, you *only use one asterisks*

For lists, you'll use an asterisk for the first bullet point and an indent plus asterisk for the second.

* First bullet point
  * indented second bullet point

Ordered lists use a number followed by a period, similar to a regular document
1. first item
2. second item
  1. subitem
