# Log Entry 2-27-25 Take Two

## Troubleshooting and Apache2

* When I was adding a log entry for apache, I somehow highlighting a specific part, erased 
it, and could no longer move my cursor. So I created a new one to add onto the other one

1. As I was saying, Apache2 wasn't difficult to understand, especially after learning more
about external IPs. 

	1. To look at the default wednpage in apache2:
	
		* use **w3m** and **localhost**

	2. Checking the external IP address on the **Google Cloud Console**

		* result should be: http://35.223.220.222 

**Note: use sudo cautiously**

* Another thing I realized when I was typing the hmtl code provided is that I have worked
with html before, mainly in formatting documents online.

**More to come**
