## Installing and Configuring PHP

* Something I've realized is I'm not needing constant reminders of commands
anymore. For example, **cd** for command is intuitive now. Additionally, using **nano** to
make notes isn't hard.

* I also inadvertently realized I have to use the arrow key to go back and edit,
something I didn't know before.

1. Installing and Configuring **PHP**

        1. Most important, making sure **apache2** is active and running when **PHP** is
installed.

        2. my personal IP Address is **35.223.220.222**

        3. Keep in mind the end of web pages will be **index.php** for the PHP
configuration, but starts as **index.html**

More to come.
