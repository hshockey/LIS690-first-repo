## Continued Markdown practice

* After getting feedback on my work so far, I wanted to spend a little time continuing to 
practice markdown and using nano. The following will mostly be notes that help future me 
understand ways to use markdown. 

1. To bold something, **make sure to use double asterisks on either side**

2. to italicize, *similarly, just use one asterisk on either side*

3. The next part are things that I haven't used much but are definitely useful and should 
remember. 

* Creating a named link is super useful 

	* [University of Kentucky](uky.edu)

* I also find the horizontal line code to be useful

Overall, I feel like these small things really help understand how to do simple text. I
will continue to work on this. 

**More or come.**
