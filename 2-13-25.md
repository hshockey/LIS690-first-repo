#Log Entry 2-13-25

Today I began with learning how to work with *apt* and packages through commands. 

I learned about *yaz-client* and how to use it to search bibliographic records. 

When using *yaz-client*, it creates Z>

* Searching is based on different commands, such as @attr 1=4 for the title field and
@attr 1=21 for subject heading field.

Practice *yaz* with this search:

* Z> find @attr 1=21 "Manga (Comic books)"
* Included 64 results

I appreciate the "see you later, alligator" when quitting Z>

More to come.
