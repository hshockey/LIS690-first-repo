#Log Entry 2-9-25

Today I focused on **grep** practice.

Out of the fifty articles that I included in the scopus search, there were 36 articles
and 14 books

I learned how to use quotations to narrow results, ex. "journal"

Plus, the sort command is great if I want to know the list of resources alphabetically.

More to come.
